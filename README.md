Page 1 – Home Page/Landing Page

Common content elements described here (navigation, header, footer) also apply to the other pages. This page should provide the following content / functionality:

Filename: index.html  
Logo / primary branding in the header  
Placeholder for login name  
Representative links for user-specific navigation (login-in, signup, etc.)
Log in and sign up links must provide navigation to saved "product details" page  
Representative links for general site navigation (home, product details, create new, about (optional), etc.)
Every page must provide navigation to all pages
Representative footer information (copyright, etc.)  
Main content area should provide an introduction and overview to the site. May be more  than simple text.
 

Page 2 – "Product Details" Page

This page should provide the following content / functionality in addition to common content:

Filename: list.html

You do not have to keep the name "Product Details". 
This page will mainly contain the list of your products. For example, if you are building a To-Do app, this page will contain a list of tasks you have already created.
Some example pointers for To-Do app (if you are building to-do). Be creative here.
At least two categories of tasks (use your creativity)  . For example, you can categorize tasks based on urgency - urgent, important, not urgent , not important or based on timeline - weekly, daily, monthly, or both etc.
At least three tasks per category/topic 
All tasks listings should link to the same "My To Do List" page, as a design placeholder  
Note that within the main content container, category/topic organization may be fancier than a plain list.
Beside each of the task/product , add buttons/icon for View,Update and Delete operations. For the time being, the "View" button/icon will lead to "View Details" page. We will implement the actions dynamically later.
 

Page 3 – "View Detail"

This page should provide the following content / functionality in addition to common content: (Note: only one "View Detail" page is needed as a representative page – not a different one for every item in the list). We will implement this dynamically later in the semester.

Filename: detail.html  
A full description  of the product you have created
be creative here
Again you do not have to keep the name "View Details". You can rename it with a different title while keeping the concept/purpose same.
 

Page 4 – "Create New Product"

This page will contain a form to create new product. After submitting the form, it should link to the saved "Product Details" page.

This page should provide the following content / functionality in addition to common content:

Filename: createNew.html  
Create a form
The form will take information about a product - for example, task name, task category, due date, status, location etc.
Again you do not have to keep the name "Create New Product". You can rename it with a different title while keeping the concept/purpose same.
